# Backend Worker - Critical Fixes Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Backend Code Issues Found

Your Cloudflare Worker backend has **critical inconsistencies** that will cause problems with quota enforcement and user experience. Below are the exact fixes needed.

---

## 1. ‚ùå CRITICAL: Free Plan Quota Mismatch

### Current Backend Code (WRONG):
```javascript
// Line in worker: "Free subscribers can generate **one article per month**"
const QUOTAS = {
  free: { generation: { perMonth: 31, perDay: 1 } },
  pro:  { generation: { perMonth: 9999, perDay: 15 } },
};
```

### Frontend Promise:
- **"1 article per week"** (7 articles/month)

### Problem:
- Backend enforces `perDay: 1` which means free users can only generate 1 article per day
- Combined with the comment saying "one article per month", this is confusing
- Frontend clearly states "1 article per week"

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED FIX:
```javascript
// CORRECT quota for free users: 1 article per week (7 per month)
const QUOTAS = {
  free: { generation: { perMonth: 7, perDay: 1 } },  // Changed from 31 to 7
  pro:  { generation: { perMonth: 9999, perDay: 15 } },
};
```

**Explanation:**
- `perDay: 1` means they can generate 1 article per day MAX
- `perMonth: 7` means they can generate 7 articles per month MAX (= 1 per week)
- This matches the frontend promise of "1 article per week"

---

## 2. ‚úÖ CORRECT: Tool Quotas

### Current Backend Code (CORRECT):
```javascript
const TOOL_QUOTA = { free: 1, pro: 10 };
```

### Frontend Promise:
- Free: "1 tool per day"
- Pro: "10 tools per day"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Matches perfectly**

---

## 3. ‚úÖ CORRECT: Pro Generation Limit

### Current Backend Code (CORRECT):
```javascript
const QUOTAS = {
  pro: { generation: { perMonth: 9999, perDay: 15 } },
};
```

### Frontend Promise:
- "15 articles per day"

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Matches perfectly**

---

## 4. ‚ùå BACKEND COMMENT WRONG

### Current Backend Comment (WRONG):
```javascript
/*
 * - Free subscribers can generate **one article per month** (plus one demo
 *   article per IP when not signed in).
 */
```

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED FIX:
```javascript
/*
 * - Free subscribers can generate **one article per week** (7 articles per month,
 *   plus one demo article per IP when not signed in).
 */
```

---

## 5. ‚ùå ERROR MESSAGE WRONG

### Current Backend Code (WRONG):
```javascript
if (!ok) {
  return jsonResponse(
    {
      error: "Quota exceeded",
      message: plan === "pro" ? "Daily limit reached (15/day)." : "Daily limit reached (1/day).",
    },
    withHeaders(),
    429
  );
}
```

### Problem:
- Message says "Daily limit reached (1/day)" but we actually want weekly limits for free users
- This is confusing because free users are limited to 7/month (1/week), not 1/day

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED FIX:
```javascript
if (!ok) {
  return jsonResponse(
    {
      error: "Quota exceeded",
      message: plan === "pro"
        ? "Daily limit reached (15 articles/day)."
        : "Weekly limit reached (1 article/week). Upgrade to Pro for 15/day.",
    },
    withHeaders(),
    429
  );
}
```

---

## 6. ‚úÖ CORRECT: Guest Demo Limit

### Current Backend Code (CORRECT):
```javascript
/**
 * Guests: 1 demo article per month per IP address.
 */
async function checkGuestIPDemo(SUPABASE_URL, ANON, ip) {
  // ... checks if demo was used within last 30 days
  if (diffDays < 30) return false;
}
```

### Frontend Promise:
- "Try free demo" (implies one-time demo before signup)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Reasonable implementation** (1 demo per month per IP)

---

## 7. ‚úÖ CORRECT: Stripe Integration

### Current Backend Variables:
- `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`: `price_1SGLN5GY9Es9mqGaPxF0HfRA`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: (encrypted)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: (encrypted)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Properly configured**

**Note:** Make sure the Stripe Price ID `price_1SGLN5GY9Es9mqGaPxF0HfRA` is set to **$24/month** in your Stripe Dashboard.

---

## 8. ‚ùå ANOTHER QUOTA ERROR MESSAGE

### Current Backend Code (Line ~442):
```javascript
const allowed = await checkGuestIPDemo(SUPABASE_URL, ANON, ip);
if (!allowed) {
  return jsonResponse(
    {
      error: "Demo limit reached",
      message: "You've used your free demo for this month.  Sign in to continue!",
    },
    withHeaders(),
    403
  );
}
```

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED FIX:
```javascript
const allowed = await checkGuestIPDemo(SUPABASE_URL, ANON, ip);
if (!allowed) {
  return jsonResponse(
    {
      error: "Demo limit reached",
      message: "You've used your free demo. Create a free account for 1 article/week!",
    },
    withHeaders(),
    403
  );
}
```

**Better message**: Tells users they get 1 article/week when they sign up
